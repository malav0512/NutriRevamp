              Protein is essential to good health. The very origin of the word —
              from the Greek <em>protos</em>, meaning "first" — reflects
              protein's top-shelf status in human nutrition. You need it to put
              meat on your bones and to make hair, blood, connective tissue,
              antibodies, enzymes, and more. It's common for athletes and
              bodybuilders to wolf down extra protein to bulk up. But the
              message the rest of us often get is that our daily protein intake
              is too high.

            <h3>Kwashiorkor</h3>
            <p>
              Kwashiorkor is a type of malnutrition characterized by severe
              protein deficiency. It causes fluid retention and a swollen,
              distended abdomen. Kwashiorkor most commonly affects children,
              particularly in developing countries with high levels of poverty
              and food insecurity. People with kwashiorkor may have food to eat,
              but not enough protein.

            <h3>How much protein do you need?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Protein should account for 10% to 35% of your calories. So, if
                your daily needs are 2,000 calories, that's 200-700 calories
                from protein or 50-175 grams.
              </li>
              <li>
                The recommended dietary allowance to prevent deficiency for an
                average sedentary adult is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body
                weight.
              </li>
              <li>
                For those over age 40-50, protein needs increase to about 1-1.2
                grams per kilogram.
              </li>
              <li>
                People who exercise regularly or lift weights need about 1.1-1.7
                grams per kilogram.

            <h3>Daily protein intake for women</h3>
            <p>
              For a 50-year-old woman who weighs 140 pounds and is sedentary
              (doesn't exercise), that translates into 53 grams of protein a
              day. During pregnancy, protein needs of women go up. Experts
              recommend 75 to 100 grams of protein a day for the developing
              fetal tissue, as well as the enlarging placenta, breasts, and
              blood supply. You should check with your doctor on your specific
              protein needs.

            <h3>Does protein have any negative health effects?</h3>
            <p>
              Some research suggests casual links between high protein diets and
              kidney function impairments. However, there is no evidence to
              suggest a direct cause and effect between the two. Further
              research has shown that following a high-protein diet can
              aggravate preexisting chronic kidney disease. People with
              preexisting kidney conditions should consult their doctor before
              drastically changing their protein intake.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, there’s no evidence that a reasonably high protein intake
              has any adverse effects in healthy people trying to optimize their
              health.

            <p>
              There is a broad range of foods that are high in protein. These
              include:
            </p>
            <ul class="row">
              <li class="col-md-4">Tofu, tempeh, and other meat substitutes</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              Most people generally don’t need to track their protein intake. If
              you’re healthy and trying to stay that way, simply eating quality
              protein sources with most of your meals, along with nutritious
              plant foods, should bring your intake to an optimal range.

              According to current dietary guidelines, a healthy adult should
              consume between 20-35% of their daily calories from fat, which
              translates to roughly 0.5-1 gram of fat per kilogram of body
              weight depending on their activity level and overall calorie

        <h3 class="mb-3">Does your body need fat?</h3>
        <p>
          Fat is an essential macronutrient that plays a vital role in
          maintaining overall health and well-being. It is a primary source of
          energy, providing more than double the calories per gram compared to
          carbohydrates or proteins. Beyond energy, fat serves several critical
          functions in the body: <strong>Cell Growth and Function</strong>: Fats
          are integral components of cell membranes, which maintain the
          structure and integrity of cells. They also support the development
          and repair of tissues. <strong>Organ Protection</strong>: Fat acts as
          a cushion, protecting vital organs like the heart, kidneys, and liver
          from physical impact and injury. It also helps insulate the body,
          maintaining a stable internal temperature.<strong>
            Absorption of Fat-Soluble Vitamins</strong
          >: Certain vitamins—A, D, E, and K—are fat-soluble, meaning they
          require dietary fat for proper absorption. Without adequate fat, the
          body cannot effectively utilize these essential vitamins, which are
          critical for vision, bone health, immunity, and blood clotting.<strong>
            Hormone Production</strong
          >: Fats are the building blocks of important hormones, including
          steroid hormones like estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol. These
          hormones regulate various bodily functions, such as metabolism, stress
          response, and reproductive health. Energy Reserve: Excess dietary fat
          is stored in adipose tissue, which serves as an energy reserve that
          the body can tap into during periods of fasting or increased energy
          demand. <strong>Brain Health</strong>: Fats, particularly omega-3 and
          omega-6 fatty acids, are crucial for brain development and function.
          They contribute to cognitive performance, mood regulation, and the
          prevention of neurological disorders.

        <h3 class="mb-3">Types of Fats</h3>
        <h4 class="mb-2">Saturated Fats</h4>
        <p>
          Saturated fats are found in animal products like meat and full-fat
          dairy. They also occur in tropical oils like palm and coconut...

        <ul class="row">
          <li class="col-md-4">Meats like beef, lamb, and pork</li>

          <li class="col-md-4">Chicken skin</li>

        </ul>
        <h4 class="mb-2">Unsaturated Fats</h4>
        <p>
          Unsaturated fats are typically liquid at room temperature. They come
          from plant sources and fatty fish, like salmon. Including unsaturated
          fats in your diet may helpTrusted Source lower your LDL cholesterol
          levels. They also provide essential fatty acids your body needs but
          can’t produce, like omega-6s and omega-3s. Foods high in unsaturated
          fat include: nontropical vegetable oils, like olive, canola, and
          soybean fatty fish, like bluefin tuna, salmon, and sardines nuts and
          seeds like walnuts, flaxseeds, and sunflower seeds other foods like
          avocados and peanut butter

        <h4 class="mb-2">Trans Fats</h4>
        <p>
          Trans fats are created artificially and also occur naturally in small
          amounts in some animal products. Trans fats raise your LDL cholesterol
          and lower your HDL (“good”) cholesterol. The main source of artificial
          trans fats in processed foods is partially hydrogenated vegetable
          oils. These fats are solid at room temperature and can improve the
          taste and shelf life of foods. The
          <strong>Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</strong>Trusted Source no
          longer recognizes partially hydrogenated vegetable oils as safe. As of
          July 2018, manufacturers can no longer add them to foods in the United
          States.

        <p>
          Carbohydrates are a type of macronutrient found in many foods and
          beverages. Most carbs occur naturally in plant-based foods, such as
          grains. Food manufacturers also add carbs to processed foods in the
          form of starch or added sugar.

        <p>
          Carbohydrates are vital for energy, disease prevention, and weight
          control. They are the body's main fuel source, breaking down into
          simple sugars during digestion and providing glucose for energy.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-3">Protecting Against Disease</h3>
        <p>
          Whole grains and dietary fiber help lower the risk of heart disease,
