            <p>
              Protein is essential to good health. The very origin of the word —
              from the Greek <em>protos</em>, meaning "first" — reflects
              protein's top-shelf status in human nutrition. You need it to put
              meat on your bones and to make hair, blood, connective tissue,
              antibodies, enzymes, and more. It's common for athletes and
              bodybuilders to wolf down extra protein to bulk up. But the
              message the rest of us often get is that our daily protein intake
              is too high.
            </p>
            <h3>Kwashiorkor</h3>
            <p>
              Kwashiorkor is a type of malnutrition characterized by severe
              protein deficiency. It causes fluid retention and a swollen,
              distended abdomen. Kwashiorkor most commonly affects children,
              particularly in developing countries with high levels of poverty
              and food insecurity. People with kwashiorkor may have food to eat,
              but not enough protein.
            </p>
            <h3>How much protein do you need?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Protein should account for 10% to 35% of your calories. So, if
                your daily needs are 2,000 calories, that's 200-700 calories
                from protein or 50-175 grams.
              </li>
              <li>
                The recommended dietary allowance to prevent deficiency for an
                average sedentary adult is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body
                weight.
              </li>
              <li>
                For those over age 40-50, protein needs increase to about 1-1.2
                grams per kilogram.
              </li>
              <li>
                People who exercise regularly or lift weights need about 1.1-1.7
                grams per kilogram.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Daily protein intake for women</h3>
            <p>
              For a 50-year-old woman who weighs 140 pounds and is sedentary
              (doesn't exercise), that translates into 53 grams of protein a
              day. During pregnancy, protein needs of women go up. Experts
              recommend 75 to 100 grams of protein a day for the developing
              fetal tissue, as well as the enlarging placenta, breasts, and
              blood supply. You should check with your doctor on your specific
              protein needs.
            </p>
            <h3>Does protein have any negative health effects?</h3>
            <p>
              Some research suggests casual links between high protein diets and
              kidney function impairments. However, there is no evidence to
              suggest a direct cause and effect between the two. Further
              research has shown that following a high-protein diet can
              aggravate preexisting chronic kidney disease. People with
              preexisting kidney conditions should consult their doctor before
              drastically changing their protein intake.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, there’s no evidence that a reasonably high protein intake
              has any adverse effects in healthy people trying to optimize their
              health.
            </p>
            <h3>How to get enough protein in your diet</h3>
            <p>
              There is a broad range of foods that are high in protein. These
              include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tofu, tempeh, and other meat substitutes</li>
              <li>Lean meats</li>
              <li>Fish</li>
              <li>Eggs</li>
              <li>Milk</li>
              <li>Greek yogurt</li>
              <li>Quinoa</li>
              <li>Legumes</li>
              <li>Nuts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Most people generally don’t need to track their protein intake. If
              you’re healthy and trying to stay that way, simply eating quality
              protein sources with most of your meals, along with nutritious
              plant foods, should bring your intake to an optimal range.

            </div>
            <p>
              According to current dietary guidelines, a healthy adult should
              consume between 20-35% of their daily calories from fat, which
              translates to roughly 0.5-1 gram of fat per kilogram of body
              weight depending on their activity level and overall calorie
              needs.
            </p>
            <h3>Does your body need fat?</h3>
            <p>
              Fat is an important source of energy you get from the food you
              eat. Your body needs fat to grow cells, protect your organs, and
              absorb fat-soluble vitamins...
            </p>
            <h3>Types of Fat</h3>
            <h4>Saturated Fats</h4>
            <p>
              Saturated fats are found in animal products like meat and full-fat

            <p>
              Unsaturated fats are typically liquid at room temperature. They
              come from plant sources and fatty fish, like salmon...
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Nontropical vegetable oils, like olive, canola, and soybean
              </li>

              <li>
                Nuts and seeds like walnuts, flaxseeds, and sunflower seeds
              </li>
              <li>Other foods like avocados and peanut butter</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Trans Fats</h4>
            <p>
              Trans fats are created artificially and also occur naturally in
              small amounts in some animal products...
            </p>
            <h3>Diets Low in Saturated Fat</h3>
            <p>
              Following an eating plan that focuses on heart-healthy foods can
              help you limit your saturated fat intake...
            </p>
            <h4>Mediterranean Diet</h4>
            <p>
              The Mediterranean diet is based on the traditional eating patterns
              of countries that border the Mediterranean Sea...
            </p>
            <h4>DASH Eating Plan</h4>
            <p>
              DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is an eating plan
              created to improve heart health...
            </p>
            <h3>Health Risks of Excess Fat Intake</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Weight Gain:</strong> Fat is high in calories, with 9
                calories per gram, which is more than twice the amount found in
                carbohydrates and protein.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Heart Disease and Stroke:</strong> Eating too much
                saturated fat can raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cancer:</strong> Some studies suggest that high-fat
                diets may be linked to several cancers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Digestive Distress:</strong> Too much fat can cause
                bloating, gas, and loose stools.
              </li>
            </ul>

            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Moderately active individuals should aim for 5-7 grams of
            carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight.
          </p>
          <h3>Daily Calorie Intake</h3>
          <p>
            The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that carbohydrates
            make up 45–65% of your total daily calories. For example, if you eat
            2,000 calories per day, you should consume 225–325 grams of
            carbohydrates.
          </p>
          <h3>Weight Loss</h3>
          <p>
            If you're trying to lose weight, you can try eating 100–150 grams of
            carbohydrates per day. You can also try breaking up your
            carbohydrates evenly throughout the day, with 40–50 grams per meal.
          </p>
          <h3>Understanding Carbohydrates</h3>
          <p>
            Carbohydrates are a type of macronutrient found in many foods and
            beverages. Most carbs occur naturally in plant-based foods, such as
            grains. Food manufacturers also add carbs to processed foods in the
            form of starch or added sugar.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fruits</li>
            <li>Vegetables</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Nuts</li>
            <li>Grains</li>
            <li>Seeds</li>
            <li>Beans, peas, and lentils</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Types of Carbohydrates</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Sugar:</strong> The simplest form of carbohydrate,
              naturally found in fruits, vegetables, and milk.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Starch:</strong> A complex carbohydrate found in
              vegetables, grains, and beans.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fiber:</strong> Essential for digestive health, found in
              fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Carbohydrates and Your Health</h3>
          <p>
            Carbohydrates are vital for energy, disease prevention, and weight
            control. They are the body's main fuel source, breaking down into
            simple sugars during digestion and providing glucose for energy.
          </p>
          <h3>Protecting Against Disease</h3>
          <p>
            Whole grains and dietary fiber help lower the risk of heart disease,
            stroke, obesity, and certain cancers. Fiber is also essential for
            optimal digestive health.
          </p>
          <h3>Controlling Weight</h3>
          <p>
            Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help
            control weight by promoting fullness with fewer calories.
          </p>
          <h3>Choose Your Carbohydrates Wisely</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Focus on fiber-rich fruits and vegetables.</li>
